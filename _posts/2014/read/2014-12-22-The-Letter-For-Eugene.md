Hi,Eugene.Long time no see.

I used to be your Oral English Class's student.

I still remember your impressive class,including Killer Game(cops and gangsters game),

Horse Racing Game,Thief and Richer Game and the Alligator Morality Disscusion

- Who's the badest mand and the most harmless man.  

However,I was very sorry(angry) to hear that now your students are careless and sloppy to your oral class.

They are doing their homeworks,reading magazinea and sleeping in class.

My roommate said this is because he thinked your class is broing and would not like to discuss
with Chinese by English for the same Chinese terrible anccent will making their spoken-English worse.

And I also hear that you too angry to thump the desk and rebuke them for ignoring your prepared class.

Sadly,They even absented from your class after your warning,
and my roommate said it because the proportion of this class's grade is small.

I don't know the details of the class,
but I believe that a teacher who still be angry for lazying student is a responsibly good teacher.

And he shouldn't be treated with such rude behaviors.

So.Let them all go to the hell!♪(^∇^*)

Only teaching the one who want to listen,the others ignore you ,you ignore them.

DON'T get mad for them.
