- 爱情，是一种怪事

<img class="cover" src="/images/2014/10/open/f1eae4a40f4bfbfaed04fa.jpg" />

在那个年代里，富有自主意识的女性似乎不受欢迎。

In that era, the independent women seem to be unwelcome.And Jane is the one.

JANE的独立性使她对爱有近乎疯狂的向往。

The independent consciousness that she had made her have a crazy desire for pure love.

他不能接受没有爱情的婚姻。

She can't accept a marriage without love.
 
她家穷困潦倒，有钱有势的卫斯理向她求婚，她也一口回绝。

Althoug her family was very poor and the richer Wesley asked her to marry him, she also refused him,resolutely. 

但当向往自由爱情的简与原本自由的汤姆相遇后，很快二人就坠入爱河。

But when she encounter Lefory, the man full of freedom and this is what Jane yearning--the love of freedom, soon they fall in love.

他们在喷泉边互诉爱意，希望时间能停在这一刻，让他们可以抛弃自己的身份，周遭的因素，一直爱下去。

They tell each other at the fountain with their love, hoping the time can stop at this moment, let they can abandon their identity and the surrounding factors, always in the honey love river.
 
只可惜在那个年代，自由的婚姻不成立。

Unfortunately, at that time, the freedom of marriage is inexistence.

理想的婚姻要以感情为基础，对亲友负责，对社会负责。

The ideal marriage is on the basis of feelings, taking responsibility for family,friends and society.

但理想的婚姻是那样可遇不可求。

But that marriage is so elusive taht only meet as luck. 

爱情可以是两个人的事，婚姻却是另一回事，它关乎亲友，关乎社会。

Love is a matter of two people, but marriage is another thing, it's about the friends, relatives and social.

当两人迈出私奔这一步，他们本可放下所有的负担，相濡以沫过完这一生。

When two people decided to take to elope this way, they  could have put down all burden and cherish their love mutually at the rest of the life.

可是，简醒了，他有家庭有责任，如果放弃一切，那他的兄弟姐妹怎么办。

However, Jane woke up, she have responsibility for her family, if give up everything, what about her brothers and sisters. 

反观自己，一样没有经济来源，要依靠他来度日。。

And rethink herself, as few economic source, have to rely on him to live. 

爱情不是面包，只有她的离开，他才有喘息的机会

Love is not bread, only her departure, he can had the chance to breathe. 

于是她放弃了，她的爱只为汤姆而绽放，仅此一次，给了他最爱的人，

So she gave up, her love‘s flower only bloom for Tom, just this once, for her loved most.

无爱的婚姻尽管能拯救她的家庭。可她是这么骄傲，不容许放下自尊向蔑视自己和家人的人屈服。

Although loveless marriage can save her family, she is so proud that not allowed to put down self-esteem to yield the man who look down her and her family . 

她靠自己的力量而活，用自己的笔，让自己成为简奥斯丁。

She depends on own strength to live, with his pen, and let herself become Jane Austen.

故事最后的重逢，让我嘘唏不已，看以轻松的对话，却在汤姆女儿的名字才看出一点端疑（不会打= =）：我爱过你，也从未忘记过你。

At the story last reunion, it made me sob unceasingly. The conversation that looks very relaxed, but we can see a bit  fracture in Tom daughter's name. Yes...

`I loved you, never forget you.`
